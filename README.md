# Flutter iOS Calculator

An iOS Calculator replica built with Flutter!

## Description

I initially worked on this project to get to know Flutter better (in 2018) and re-picked it up many years later
(in 2022) to make it public.<br> The logic behind is an almost exact replica of the actual iPhone Calculator provided 
by iOS 11.

The project structure and all the dependencies are updated, but I didn't have time to migrate to null safety.

## Features provided

- glowing effect on buttons
- swipe to cancel
- localized number format
- long press to select (but copy/paste actions are missing)

## Other notes

- The UI works as expected on iOS platforms only.
- The main page is called "basic" because the actual app can switch to "scientific" when you rotate the phone (not 
implemented).
